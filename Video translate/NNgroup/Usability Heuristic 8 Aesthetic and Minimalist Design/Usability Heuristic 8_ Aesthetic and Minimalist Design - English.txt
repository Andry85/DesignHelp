One of Jakob's ten heuristics for interfaces 

is to use an aesthetic and minimalist design.

That heuristic doesn't mean that you have to use 

a flat design or a monochromatic color palette.

It's more about making sure

that you're keeping the content

and the visual design of your UI

focused on the essentials

This is closely related to the human-computer

interaction concept of a signal-to-noise ratio.

The signal-to-noise ratio represents the ratio

of relevant to irrelevant information.

In a user interface, the information 

involved in this ratio could be anything:

text content, visual elements, or animation.

Essentially anything that users have to process

could count as signal or noise.

To improve the efficiency of communicating 

information through your designs

and to help users complete their tasks, 

aim for a high signal-to-noise ratio.

Every extra unit of information in a UI competes with the relevant units of information

and diminishes their relative visibility.

As a consequence, it's important to

prioritize your content and features.

If something would be used infrequently

or by a small number of users who don't 

contribute much to your company's goals,

it might be a candidate for removal.

It's also important to make sure that the

visuals, particularly graphics or photos,

support the primary goals of users

or your company.

In other words, you shouldn't have many visual

elements that aren't there for any other reason

than to look pretty or to take up space.

Communicate, don't decorate.
